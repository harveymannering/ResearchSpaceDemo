This is a spring boot project that uses the command line to print out simple info about a users first 20 samples.  I've left my API key in so by default it should get the three samples in my account.  If a sample is less than a week away from expiring it will print out a warning above that sample.  I've also added some simple error checking.  If you have any issues or questions feel free to email me at harveymannering@gmail.com
